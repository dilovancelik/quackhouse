## About Quackhouse

Welcome to my project, the open-source solution for data modeling. Previously I've built an website where you could upload your files and interact with them in duckdb. The feedback from that tool was that people weren't necesarily happy with having to write sql. Therefore I've built this new version, where you can define relationships between tables and then interact with them through a UI.

Built on cutting-edge technologies like DuckDB, Rust, and WebAssembly, our platform runs entirely in your browser, ensuring that your data never leaves your device. By harnessing the power of modern client-side processing, we provide a robust and secure environment for managing data while maintaining lightning-fast performance.

## Key Features

- Local Data Processing: All computations are performed directly in your browser, ensuring no external servers are involved.
- Blazing Fast Performance: Powered by DuckDB and Rust, the platform delivers unparalleled speed and efficiency.
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs seamlessly on any modern browser without requiring additional installations.
Let me know what you think.

This is just a POC, and I don't know what to do with it the next. If you have any great ideas I would love to hear from you. You can reach me on bluesky or linkedin.
